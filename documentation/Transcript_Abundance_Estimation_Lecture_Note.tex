\section*{Introduction \& motivation}
\textbf{Transcript Abundance Estimation} is a problem which finds relative abundances of different RNA-transcripts from a set of reads, where the reads themselves were generated from those transcripts.\\
Expectation-Maximization Algorithm is a systematic way to deduce the unknown parameters of a system, from some known observations and some known parameters of a system, through multiple iterations of expectations and maximizations.\\
In this note, a bridge will be constructed between the concepts stated above.

\section*{Prerequisites}
To understand this topic, you need to have some basic knowledge about:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Basic of Probability and Distributions}: Different kinds of distributions and their mean, variance, likelihood; Sampling, Events.
\item \textbf{Central Dogma of Genetics}: Interactive relations between DNAs, RNAs and Proteins.
\item \textbf{Some Advanced Concepts of Computational Biology}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Short Read Mapping
    \item Alternative Splicing
    \item *-seq
    \item RNA-seq
\end{itemize}
